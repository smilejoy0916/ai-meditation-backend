# Meditation App Update Summary

## Overview

This update implements three major requirements to enhance the meditation app's configurability and security.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. Password Management in Admin Panel ✅

**What Changed:**

- Added `user_password` and `admin_password` fields to the admin settings
- Passwords are now stored in the database (admin_settings table) instead of just environment variables
- Admin panel now includes a "Password Management" section where both user and admin passwords can be changed
- Password fields include show/hide toggle buttons for security
- Authentication endpoint now reads passwords from database first, with fallback to environment variables

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/main.py` - Updated models and auth endpoint
- `backend/services/supabase_service.py` - Added password fields to settings
- `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added password management UI

### 2. Break Duration Changed from 60 to 45 Seconds ✅

**What Changed:**

- Default silence duration between chapters changed from 1 minute (60s) to 45 seconds
- Made the silence duration configurable through admin settings
- Added `silence_duration_seconds` field with default value of 45

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/main.py` - Uses `silence_duration_seconds` from settings
- `backend/services/supabase_service.py` - Added default value of 45 seconds
- `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added "Break Duration" input field

### 3. Configurable Chapter Count (More Than 3 Chapters) ✅

**What Changed:**

- Added `chapter_count` field to admin settings (default: 3, range: 1-10)
- Updated `split_meditation_into_chapters()` function to accept variable chapter count
- Updated default system prompt to support flexible number of chapters
- AI prompt now generates variable number of `<break>` tags based on chapter count

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/main.py` - Passes chapter_count to meditation generation
- `backend/services/openai_service.py` - Updated split function to accept chapter_count parameter
- `backend/services/supabase_service.py` - Updated default prompt to support variable chapters
- `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added "Chapter Count" input field

## New Admin Settings Fields

The admin panel now includes these additional settings:

1. **Chapter Count** (1-10)

   - Controls how many chapters the meditation is split into
   - More chapters = more break periods
   - Default: 3

2. **Break Duration (seconds)** (1-300)

   - Duration of silence between chapters
   - Default: 45 seconds
   - Previously hardcoded at 60 seconds

3. **User Password**

   - Password for regular user access
   - Can be updated through admin panel
   - Falls back to USER_PASSWORD env var if not set in database

4. **Admin Password**
   - Password for admin access
   - Can be updated through admin panel
   - Falls back to ADMIN_PASSWORD env var if not set in database

## Database Migration

A new migration file has been created: `supabase_migration_add_new_settings.sql`

**To apply the migration:**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration file to add the new columns:
   - `chapter_count` (INTEGER, default: 3)
   - `silence_duration_seconds` (INTEGER, default: 45)
   - `user_password` (TEXT, default: 'user')
   - `admin_password` (TEXT, default: 'admin')

## How to Use

### Changing Password

1. Log in to admin panel
2. Scroll to "Password Management" section
3. Update "User Password" and/or "Admin Password"
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. New passwords take effect immediately

### Adjusting Break Duration

1. Log in to admin panel
2. Scroll to "Meditation Generation Settings"
3. Change "Break Duration (seconds)" value
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Next meditation generation will use new duration

### Changing Chapter Count

1. Log in to admin panel
2. Scroll to "Meditation Generation Settings"
3. Change "Chapter Count" value (1-10)
4. Optionally adjust the system prompt if you want specific guidance for each chapter
5. Click "Save Settings"
6. Next meditation generation will create the specified number of chapters

## Technical Details

### Chapter Count Implementation

- The system prompt has been updated to be flexible with chapter counts
- The `<break>` tag is used to mark chapter boundaries
- AI generates meditation with variable number of `<break>` tags
- `split_meditation_into_chapters()` splits text at `<break>` tags
- If AI generates more chapters than requested, extras are combined into the last chapter
- If AI generates fewer chapters than requested, empty chapters are padded

### Backward Compatibility

- All new settings have sensible defaults
- Existing installations will work without database migration
- Environment variables are still used as fallback
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Password Management:**

   - Change user password and verify user login works
   - Change admin password and verify admin login works
   - Verify old passwords no longer work

2. **Break Duration:**

   - Generate meditation with 45s breaks (default)
   - Try different durations (30s, 60s, 90s)
   - Listen to verify correct silence duration

3. **Chapter Count:**
   - Generate meditation with 3 chapters (default)
   - Try with 2 chapters (minimal)
   - Try with 5+ chapters (extended)
   - Verify correct number of break periods

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. Passwords are stored in plain text in the database
2. For production use, consider implementing password hashing
3. Ensure Supabase access is properly secured
4. Consider implementing session timeout for admin access
5. Use strong passwords when deploying to production

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- Password hashing for better security
- Password strength validation
- Password change confirmation dialog
- Chapter count validation in AI prompt
- Preview of meditation structure before generation
- User roles and permissions system
